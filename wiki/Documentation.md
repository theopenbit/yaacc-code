# Player

Selecting and playing  media files is the main feature of yaacc - who is wondering :-) But the player concept of yaacc is really flexible. Yaacc is able to control an  amount of players, which is only limited by your device. 
A player can be either a local player or a player for controlling a remote upnp device in your network. For example it is possible to play music and a slide show at the same time on your device. And it is possible that the music in this example is controlled by an remote device and the slide show is controlled by the local device in your hand.
There are no restrictions in combining players and devices. With yaacc you are able to control a slide show streamed on a beamer and a music stream played by your internet radio receiver at the same time.

# Upnp renderer
If enabled in the settings menu, yaacc is able to receive upnp AVTransport commands. This feature allows you to stream media of an upnp content directory  to your device.
A use case for this may be using an android HDMI stick on your TV with yaacc installed on it and then stream a media file from your content directory to the stick using a upnp controller your choice. With yaacc as upnp controller you are able to control different media renderer at the same time. With yaacc as upnp media renderer you are able to build your multimedia tv using a normal tv and a android device. 

# Upnp content directory
Yaacc is able to serve the media of your android device in the network. If enabled the server in the settings menu all media files in your mediastore are accessible by other upnp devices in your network.
For example the use case for this is streaming your photo gallery on your device to an TV without setup an wired connection.  




# About dialog

Surely yaacc has an about dialog. It is displaying all license information. Yaacc based on different open source projects for doing all the upnp network stuff or creating icons. Many thanks to these projects. Yaacc is possible because of those guys!
